  <strong>
    Understand how React hooks work by building them from scratch
  </strong>
  <p>
    React hooks are a core building block upon which we build our React apps. Understanding them at a fundamental level will help you use them more efficiently. You'll go from "it doesn't work and I don't know why" to "it works and I understand why."

## Prerequisites

- [Experience with React hooks](https://www.epicreact.dev/hooks)

## Pre-workshop Resources

Here are some resources you can read before taking the workshop to get you up to
speed on some of the tools and concepts we'll be covering:

- [Getting Closure on React Hooks](https://www.swyx.io/hooks)

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.18 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v18 or greater
- [npm][npm] v8 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

This is a pretty large project (it's actually many apps in one) so it can take
several minutes to get everything set up the first time. Please have a strong
network connection before running the setup and grab a snack.

> **Warning**: This repo is _very_ large. Make sure you have a good internet
> connection before you start the setup process. The instructions below use
> `--depth` to limit the amount you download, but if you have a slow connection,
> or you pay for bandwidth, you may want to find a place with a better
> connection.

Follow these steps to get this set up:

```sh nonumber
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/epicweb-dev/build-react-hooks.git
cd build-react-hooks
npm run setup
```

If you experience errors here, please open [an issue][issue] with as many
details as you can offer.

## The Workshop App

Learn all about the workshop app on the
[Epic Web Getting Started Guide](https://www.epicweb.dev/get-started).
