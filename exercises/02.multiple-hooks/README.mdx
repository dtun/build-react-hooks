# Multiple Hooks

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/tutorials/build-react-hooks/introduction-to-multiple-hooks" />

Often components require more than a single hook. In fact, often they'll use
two or more of the `useState` hook. If we tried that with our implementation
right now things wouldn't work so well and I think you can imagine why.

The tricky part about this is when you have more than one hook, you need to be
able to track their values over the lifetime of the component relative to each
other and that component. What makes this difficult though is that there's no
uniquely identifying information about the hooks:

```tsx
const [count1, setCount1] = useState(0)
const [count2, setCount2] = useState(0)
```

Having two elements of state like this in a component is perfectly legitimate,
but our current implementation wouldn't work for that at all because the state
would be shared between the two hooks.

So how do we get around that?

Well, it's not entirely true to say that there's no uniquely identifying
information about the hooks.... There actually is something unique about these
function calls and that is the order in which they are called!

If we can assume that they'll always be called in the same order, then we can
assign the first one an ID of `0` and the second one an ID of `1`. Then we can
use that ID to track the state of the hooks!

Something you will hopefully gather from this exercise is an understanding of
why the ["rules of hooks"](https://react.dev/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks) is
a thing. Specifically the rule that hooks must be called at the top level (and
not conditionally).

So, let's get into it!
