# useState

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/tutorials/build-react-hooks/introduction-to-usestate" />

The `useState` hook is one of the most common hooks and is a good place for us
to start because it triggers re-rendering of the component and we can observe
its effects in the UI.

The goal of this exercise is not to build something super rigourous, but instead
to hack away until it works.

Here's the basic API that we need to implement in this exercise:

```tsx
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)

function handleEvent() {
	setState(newState)
}
```

The `useState` hook accepts an initial value, and returns an array with two
values:

- `state`: the current value of the state
- `setState`: a function that updates the state

We will use the `setState` function to update the state of the component. But
just updating the state is not enough. We need to trigger a re-render of the
component as well.

Because we're not React, we need to hack away at things a little bit. For
example, the built-in `useState` hook is _the_ way to trigger re-renders, but
since we'll be implementing `useState` ourselves, we'll have to be creative on
how we trigger re-renders.

Another tricky thing will be ensuring we can keep track of the state external to
our component so when the component gets rendered again we can access the latest
version of the state.

Let's get into it!
