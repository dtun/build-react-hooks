# Initial State

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/tutorials/build-react-hooks/render-an-initial-state" />

👨‍💼 Hello! So here's where we're starting out:

```tsx
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'

function Counter() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
	const increment = () => setCount(count + 1)

	return (
		<div className="counter">
			<button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
		</div>
	)
}

const rootEl = document.createElement('div')
document.body.append(rootEl)
const appRoot = createRoot(rootEl)
appRoot.render(<Counter />)
```

Pretty simple, except the `useState` function isn't defined and we're not
allowed to simply import it from React because we're not allowed to directly use
any React hooks in this workshop!

And because it's not defined, our `Counter` component won't be able to render
anything (because an error will be thrown).

So let's just get it to the point where the `Counter` component renders
initially without errors. When you're done, it should render a button with a `0`
in it.

The emoji should lead the way!
